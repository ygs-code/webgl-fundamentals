    <h1>WebGL - Part 2, Cameras</h1>
    <p>This post is a continuation of a series of posts about WebGL.
The first <a href="webgl-fundamentals.html">started with fundamentals</a> and
the previous was about <a href="webgl-3d-orthograpic.html">3d orthographics projection </a>.
If you haven't read those please view them first.</p>
<p>It's been around 7 months since I wrote the last article. Why? Because I'm a lazy S.O.B.
of course. In reality though the biggest reason is I kept trying to write the next
article on perspective projections and kept feeling like I was having to make
too many giant leaps that would be hard to explain all at once.</p>
<p>I finally decided that I needed to stick with orthographic matrices
for at least one more article and add a few things before moving on to
perspective.</p>
<p>The first thing we need to go over is setting the z-clip space.
Up to this point we've been using pixels. In X and Y we've been using
the size of our canvas element which for all the samples has been 400x300
pixels. That means for X and Y our values are clipped in X to values from
0 to 400 and in Y from 0 to 300.</p>
<p>For 3D that's not the normal way to work. The "normal" way to work
is to pick some range of "How much do we want to see". Maybe we want
to view something 800 unit tall in our 400x300 viewing area.</p>
<p>In that case we can easily generalize our orthographic matrix.
Our code actually already does this. The function make2DProjection
takes a width and a height and we've been passing in the width
and height of the canvas but we can pass in anything. If want to see
800 units of virtual we just call with that value</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"
   var projectionMatrix =
        make2DProjection(canvas.clientWidth, 800, ...);
</pre>

<p>Here's what happens.</p>
<iframe class="webgl_example" src="../webgl-3d-orthographic-800-vertical-units.html" width="400" height="300"></iframe>

<p><a class="webgl_center" href="../webgl-3d-orthographic-800-vertical-units.html" target="_blank">click here to open in a separate window</a></p>
<p>It's squished. We've got 800 vertical units display in 300 vertical pixels
but only 400 horizontal units in 400 pixels.  It would be nice to separate
the number of units we want to see completely from the size of
our canvas. That way no mater what size our canvas is we can
choose how many units to display.</p>
<p>To do this we might consider changing the function to take
how many units we want to see down the canvas and then compute
how many units we can see across the canvas.</p>
<p>Let's change our function to do that.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
  function makeOrthographicProjection(
      unitsDown, aspectRatioOfCanvas, depth) {
      var unitsAcross = unitsDown * aspectRatioOfCanvas;
  return [
     2 / unitsAcross, 0, 0, 0,
     0, -2 / unitsDown, 0, 0,
     0, 0, 2 / depth, 0,
    -1, 1, 0, 1,
  ];
</pre>

<p>And here's how we call it.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
  var unitsDown = 800;
  var aspectRatioOfCanvas = canvas.clientWidth / canvas.clientHeight;
  var projectionMatrix = makeOrthographicProjection(
      unitsDown,
      aspectRatioOfCanvas,
      depth);
</pre>

<p>And now things are back to normal.</p>
<iframe class="webgl_example" src="../webgl-3d-orthographic-aspect.html" width="400" height="300"></iframe>

<p><a class="webgl_center" href="../webgl-3d-orthographic-aspect.html" target="_blank">click here to open in a separate window</a></p>
<p>The next thing we're doing that's out of the ordinary for 3D is we're clipping
from 0 to unitsAcross horizontally and 0 to unitsDown vertically. Going from 0 to width horizontally
and 0 to height vertically is often fine when doing 2d image processing or UI work
but it's less desirable when doing 3D work. Why? Beacuse in 3D we usually have a camera.
When you use a real camera you usually look through the view finder, figure out where you want
your subject (often the center or just off center).</p>
<p>As it is now though, computing where that center is requires knowing how many units
across and down the view is. If our view is 1000x800 units then we'd need to some how
move the camera to 500x400. If our view is 300x200 units we'd need to move the camera
to 150x100.</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be easier if we made it so the camera is just naturally in the center
of the view?</p>
<p>Let's change our matrix to make the center of our view 0,0. All we have to is stop
adding 1 at the bottom</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
  function makeOrthographicProjection(
      unitsDown, aspectRatioOfCanvas, depth) {
      var unitsAcross = unitsDown * aspectRatioOfCanvas;
  return [
     2 / unitsAcross, 0, 0, 0,
     0, -2 / unitsDown, 0, 0,
     0, 0, 2 / depth, 0,
     0, 0, 0, 1,
  ];
</pre>

<p>Now the range is -unitAcross&nbsp;/&nbsp;2 to unitsAcross&nbsp;/&nbsp;2 horizontally and
unitsDown&nbsp;/&nbsp;2 to -unitsDown&nbsp;/&nbsp;2 vertically but 0.0 is in the center
which will make it easier to position our camera.</p>
<p>In the last post we went over how 2d matrices worked. We talked
about translation, rotation, scaling, and even projecting from
pixels into clip space can all be done by 1 matrix and some magic
matrix math. To do 3D is only a small step from there.</p>
<p>In our previous 2D examples we had 2D points (x, y) that we multiplied by
a 3x3 matrix. To do 3D we need 3D points (x, y, z) and a 4x4 matrix.</p>
<p>Let's take our last example and change it to 3D. We'll use an F again but this time a 3D 'F'.</p>
<p>The first thing we need to do is change the vertex shader to handle 3D. Here's the old shader.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;script id="2d-vertex-shader" type="x-shader/x-vertex"&gt;
attribute vec2 a_position;

uniform mat3 u_matrix;

void main() {
  // Multiply the position by the matrix.
  gl_Position = vec4((u_matrix * vec3(a_position, 1)).xy, 0, 1);
}
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p>And here's the new one</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;script id="3d-vertex-shader" type="x-shader/x-vertex"&gt;
attribute vec4 a_position;

uniform mat4 u_matrix;

void main() {
  // Multiply the position by the matrix.
  gl_Position = u_matrix * a_position;
}
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p>It got even simpler!</p>
<p>Then we need to provide 3D data.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
  ...

  gl.vertexAttribPointer(positionLocation, 3, gl.FLOAT, false, 0, 0);

  ...

// Fill the buffer with the values that define a letter 'F'.
function setGeometry(gl) {
  gl.bufferData(
      gl.ARRAY_BUFFER,
      new Float32Array([
          // left column
            0,   0,  0,
           30,   0,  0,
            0, 150,  0,
            0, 150,  0,
           30,   0,  0,
           30, 150,  0,

          // top rung
           30,   0,  0,
          100,   0,  0,
           30,  30,  0,
           30,  30,  0,
          100,   0,  0,
          100,  30,  0,

          // middle rung
           30,  60,  0,
           67,  60,  0,
           30,  90,  0,
           30,  90,  0,
           67,  60,  0,
           67,  90,  0]),
      gl.STATIC_DRAW);
}
</pre>

<p>Next we need to change all the matrix functions from 2D to 3D</p>
<p>Here's the 2D (before) versions of makeTranslation, makeRotation and makeScale</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
function makeTranslation(tx, ty) {
  return [
    1, 0, 0,
    0, 1, 0,
    tx, ty, 1
  ];
}

function makeRotation(angleInRadians) {
  var c = Math.cos(angleInRadians);
  var s = Math.sin(angleInRadians);
  return [
    c,-s, 0,
    s, c, 0,
    0, 0, 1
  ];
}

function makeScale(sx, sy) {
  return [
    sx, 0, 0,
    0, sy, 0,
    0, 0, 1
  ];
}
</pre>

<p>And here's the updated 3D versions.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
function makeTranslation(tx, ty, tz) {
  return [
     1,  0,  0,  0,
     0,  1,  0,  0,
     0,  0,  1,  0,
     tx, ty, tz, 1
  ];
}

function makeXRotation(angleInRadians) {
  var c = Math.cos(angleInRadians);
  var s = Math.sin(angleInRadians);

  return [
    1, 0, 0, 0,
    0, c, s, 0,
    0, -s, c, 0,
    0, 0, 0, 1
  ];
};

function makeYRotation(angleInRadians) {
  var c = Math.cos(angleInRadians);
  var s = Math.sin(angleInRadians);

  return [
    c, 0, -s, 0,
    0, 1, 0, 0,
    s, 0, c, 0,
    0, 0, 0, 1
  ];
};

function makeZRotation(angleInRadians) {
  var c = Math.cos(angleInRadians);
  var s = Math.sin(angleInRadians);
  return [
     c, s, 0, 0,
    -s, c, 0, 0,
     0, 0, 1, 0,
     0, 0, 0, 1,
  ];
}

function makeScale(sx, sy, sz) {
  return [
    sx, 0,  0,  0,
    0, sy,  0,  0,
    0,  0, sz,  0,
    0,  0,  0,  1,
  ];
}
</pre>

<p>Notice we now have 3 rotations functions.  We only needed one in 2D as we
were effectively only rotating around the Z axis.  Now though to do 3D we
also want to be able to rotate around the x axis and y axis as well.  You
can see from looking at them they are all very similar.  If we were to
work them out you'd see them simplify just like before</p>
<p>Z rotation</p>
<div class="webgl_center">
<div>newX = x *  c + y * s;</div>
<div>newY = x * -s + y * c;</div>
</div>

<p>Y rotation</p>
<div class="webgl_center">
<div>newX = x *  c + z * s;</div>
<div>newZ = x * -s + z * c;</div>
</div>

<p>X rotation</p>
<div class="webgl_center">
<div>newY = y *  c + z * s;</div>
<div>newZ = y * -s + z * c;</div>
</div>

<p>which gives you these rotations.</p>
<iframe class="external_diagram" src="resources/axis-diagram.html" width="540" height="240"></iframe>

<p>We also need to update the projection function. Here's the old one</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
function make2DProjection(width, height) {
  // Note: This matrix flips the Y axis so 0 is at the top.
  return [
    2 / width, 0, 0,
    0, -2 / height, 0,
    -1, 1, 1
  ];
}
</pre>

<p>which converted from pixels to clip space. For our first attempt at expanding it to 3D let's try</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
function make2DProjection(width, height, depth) {
  // Note: This matrix flips the Y axis so 0 is at the top.
  return [
     2 / width, 0, 0, 0,
     0, -2 / height, 0, 0,
     0, 0, 2 / depth, 0,
    -1, 1, 0, 1,
  ];
}
</pre>

<p>Just like we needed to convert from pixels to clipspace for x and y, for
z we need to do the same thing.  In this case I'm making the Z space pixel
units as well.  I'll pass in some value similar to <em>width</em> for the depth
so our space will be 0 to width pixels wide, 0 to height pixels tall, but
for depth it will be -depth / 2 to +depth / 2.</p>
<p>Finally we need to to update the code that computes the matrix.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
  // Compute the matrices
  var projectionMatrix =
      make2DProjection(canvas.clientWidth, canvas.clientHeight, 400);
  var translationMatrix =
      makeTranslation(translation[0], translation[1], translation[2]);
  var rotationXMatrix = makeXRotation(rotation[0]);
  var rotationYMatrix = makeYRotation(rotation[1]);
  var rotationZMatrix = makeZRotation(rotation[2]);
  var scaleMatrix = makeScale(scale[0], scale[1], scale[2]);

  // Multiply the matrices.
  var matrix = matrixMultiply(scaleMatrix, rotationZMatrix);
  matrix = matrixMultiply(matrix, rotationYMatrix);
  matrix = matrixMultiply(matrix, rotationXMatrix);
  matrix = matrixMultiply(matrix, translationMatrix);
  matrix = matrixMultiply(matrix, projectionMatrix);

  // Set the matrix.
  gl.uniformMatrix4fv(matrixLocation, false, matrix);
</pre>

<p>And here's that sample.</p>
<iframe class="webgl_example" src="../webgl-3d-step1.html" width="400" height="300"></iframe>

<p><a class="webgl_center" href="../webgl-3d-step1.html" target="_blank">click here to open in a separate window</a></p>
<p>The first problem we have is that our geometry is a flat F which makes it
hard to see any 3D.  To fix that let's expand the geometry to 3D.  Our
current F is made of 3 rectangles, 2 triangles each.  To make it 3D will
require a total of 16 rectangles.  That's quite a few to list out here.
16 rectangles * 2 triangles per rectangle * 3 vertices per triangle is 96
vertices.  If you want to see all of them view source on the sample.</p>
<p>We have to draw more vertices so</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
    // Draw the geometry.
    gl.drawArrays(gl.TRIANGLES, 0, 16 * 6);
</pre>

<p>And here's that version</p>
<iframe class="webgl_example" src="../webgl-3d-step2.html" width="400" height="300"></iframe>

<p><a class="webgl_center" href="../webgl-3d-step2.html" target="_blank">click here to open in a separate window</a></p>
<p>Moving the sliders it's pretty hard to tell that it's 3D.  Let's try
coloring each rectangle a different color.  To do this we will add another
attribute to our vertex shader and a varying to pass it from the vertex
shader to the fragment shader.</p>
<p>Here's the new vertex shader</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;script id="3d-vertex-shader" type="x-shader/x-vertex"&gt;
attribute vec4 a_position;
attribute vec4 a_color;

uniform mat4 u_matrix;

varying vec4 v_color;

void main() {
  // Multiply the position by the matrix.
  gl_Position = u_matrix * a_position;

  // Pass the color to the fragment shader.
  v_color = a_color;
}
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p>And we need to use that color in the fragment shader</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;script id="3d-vertex-shader" type="x-shader/x-fragment"&gt;
precision mediump float;

// Passed in from the vertex shader.
varying vec4 v_color;

void main() {
   gl_FragColor = v_color;
}
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p>We need to lookup the location to supply the colors, then setup another
buffer and attribute to give it the colors.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
  ...
  var colorLocation = gl.getAttribLocation(program, "a_color");

  ...
  // Create a buffer for colors.
  var buffer = gl.createBuffer();
  gl.bindBuffer(gl.ARRAY_BUFFER, buffer);
  gl.enableVertexAttribArray(colorLocation);

  // We'll supply RGB as bytes.
  gl.vertexAttribPointer(colorLocation, 3, gl.UNSIGNED_BYTE, true, 0, 0);

  // Set Colors.
  setColors(gl);

  ...
// Fill the buffer with colors for the 'F'.

function setColors(gl) {
  gl.bufferData(
      gl.ARRAY_BUFFER,
      new Uint8Array([
          // left column front
        200,  70, 120,
        200,  70, 120,
        200,  70, 120,
        200,  70, 120,
        200,  70, 120,
        200,  70, 120,

          // top rung front
        200,  70, 120,
        200,  70, 120,
        ...
        ...
      gl.STATIC_DRAW);
}
</pre>

<p>Now we get this.</p>
<iframe class="webgl_example" src="../webgl-3d-step3.html" width="400" height="300"></iframe>

<p><a class="webgl_center" href="../webgl-3d-step3.html" target="_blank">click here to open in a separate window</a></p>
<p>Uh oh, what's that's mess?  Well, it turns out all the various parts of
that 3D 'F', front, back, sides, etc get drawn in the order they appear in
our geometry.  That doesn't give us quite the desired results as sometimes
the ones in the back get drawn after the ones in the front.</p>
<p>Triangles in WebGL have the concept of front facing and back facing.  A
front facing triangle has its vertices go in a clockwise direction.  A
back facing triangle has its vertices go in a counter clockwise direction</p>
<p><img src="resources/triangle-winding.svg" class="webgl_center" width="400" /></p>
<p>WebGL has the ability to draw only forward facing or back facing
triangles.  We can turn that feature on with</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
  gl.enable(gl.CULL_FACE);
</pre>

<p>which we do just once, right at the start of our program.  With that
feature turned on, WebGL defaults to "culling" back facing triangles.
"Culling" in this case is a fancy word for "not drawing".</p>
<p>Note that as far as WebGL is conserned, whether or not a triangle is
considered to be going clockwise or counter clockwise depends on the
vertices of that triangle in clipspace.  In other words, WebGL figures out
whether a triangle is front or back AFTER you've applied math to the
vertices in the vertex shader.  That means for example a clockwise
triangle that is scaled in X by -1 becomes a counter clockwise triangle or
a clockwise triangle rotated 180 degrees becomes a couter clockwise
triangle.  Because we had CULL_FACE disabled we can see both
clockwise(front) and counter clockwise(back) triangles.  Now that we've
turned it on, any time a front facing triangle flips around either because
of scaling or rotation or for whatever reason, WebGL won't draw it.
That's a good thing since as your turn something around in 3D you
generally want which ever triangles are facing you to be considered front
facing.</p>
<p>With CULL_FACE turned on this is what we get</p>
<iframe class="webgl_example" src="../webgl-3d-step4.html" width="400" height="300"></iframe>

<p><a class="webgl_center" href="../webgl-3d-step4.html" target="_blank">click here to open in a separate window</a></p>
<p>Hey!  Where did all the triangles go?  It turns out, many of them are
facing the wrong way.  Rotate it and you'll see them appear when you look
at the other side.  Fortunately it's easy to fix.  We just look at which
ones are backward and exchange 2 of their vertices.  For example if one
backward triangle is</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
           1,   2,   3,
          40,  50,  60,
         700, 800, 900,
</pre>

<p>we just flip the last 2 vertices to make it forward.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
           1,   2,   3,
         700, 800, 900,
          40,  50,  60,
</pre>

<p>Going through and fixing all the backward triangles gets us to this</p>
<iframe class="webgl_example" src="../webgl-3d-step5.html" width="400" height="300"></iframe>

<p><a class="webgl_center" href="../webgl-3d-step5.html" target="_blank">click here to open in a separate window</a></p>
<p>That's closer but there's still one more problem.  Even with all the
triangles facing in the correct direction and with the back facing ones
being culled we still have places where triangles that should be in back
are being drawn in over triangles that should be in front.</p>
<p>Enter the DEPTH BUFFER.</p>
<p>A Depth buffer, sometimes called a Z-Buffer, is a rectangle of <em>depth</em>
pixels, one depth pixel for each color pixel used to make the image.  As
WebGL draws each color pixel it can also draw a depth pixel.  It does this
based on the values we return from the vertex shader for Z.  Just like we
had to convert to clip space for X and Y, so to Z is in clip space or (-1
to +1).  That value is then converted into a depth space value (0 to +1).
Before WebGL draws a color pixel it will check the corresponding depth
pixel.  If the depth value for the pixel it's about to draw is greater
than the value of the corresponding depth pixel then WebGL does not draw
the new color pixel.  Otherwise it draws both the new color pixel with the
color from your fragment shader AND it draws the depth pixel with the new
depth value.  This means, pixels that are behind other pixels won't get
drawn.</p>
<p>We can turn on this feature nearly as simply as we turned on culling with</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
  gl.enable(gl.DEPTH_TEST);
</pre>

<p>We also need to clear the depth buffer back to 1.0 before we start drawing.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
  // Draw the scene.
  function drawScene() {
    // Clear the canvas AND the depth buffer.
    gl.clear(gl.COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | gl.DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);
    ...
</pre>

<p>And now we get</p>
<iframe class="webgl_example" src="../webgl-3d-step6.html" width="400" height="300"></iframe>

<p><a class="webgl_center" href="../webgl-3d-step6.html" target="_blank">click here to open in a separate window</a></p>
<p>which is 3D!</p>
<p>In the next post I'll go over <a href="webgl-3d-perspective-camera.html">how to make it have perspective</a>.</p>
<div class="webgl_bottombar">
<h3>Why is the attribute vec4 but gl.vertexAttribPointer size 3</h3>
<p>
For those of you who are detail oriented you might have noticed we defined our 2 attributes as
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
attribute vec4 a_position;
attribute vec4 a_color;
</pre>
<p>both of which are 'vec4' but when we tell WebGL how to take data out of our buffers we used</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
  gl.vertexAttribPointer(positionLocation, 3, gl.FLOAT, false, 0, 0);
  gl.vertexAttribPointer(colorLocation, 3, gl.UNSIGNED_BYTE, true, 0, 0);
</pre>
<p>
That '3' in each of those says only to pull out 3 values per attribute.
This works because in the vertex shader WebGL provides defaults for those
you don't supply.  The defaults are 0, 0, 0, 1 where x = 0, y = 0, z = 0
and w = 1.  This is why in our old 2D vertex shader we had to explicitly
supply the 1.  We were passing in x and y and we needed a 1 for z but
because the default for z is 0 we had to explicitly supply a 1.  For 3D
though, even though we don't supply a 'w' it defaults to 1 which is what
we need for the matrix math to work.
